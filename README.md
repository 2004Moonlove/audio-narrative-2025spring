# Spring Festival At Pittsburgh
The Spring Festival, also known as Chinese New Year (CNY), is the most important and widely celebrated traditional festival in China. It marks the beginning of the lunar new year and is a time for family reunions, festive celebrations, and cultural traditions that have been passed down for generations. It is one of the most important festival in China when family go back to visit relatives and friends greeting each other, having New Year Eve reunion Dinner together, watching Spring Festival Gala, setting off fireworks and firecrackers to celebrate the festival, having dinner together and wait for the new year to come. It is like the Christmas here.  
This audio sound is a record of I going back home from the bus at the Spring Festival day which is include a record sound of taking bus, walking back home and opening the door with my keys, walking in to my room laying on the bed, receiving messages from my family which is videos for the fireworks that they set. And then, I decided to make a phone call to my parents, where you would hear a sound of phone ring and my parents pick up. We expressed our greetings, care, and New Year's wishes to each other. My family call includes my mother, my dad and my aunt. By the end of the sound is their permission for me to use their voice.

## this part is also post on the queue for reflection
**Works:**    
This is the first time I worked on the sound, and also the first time to work with Audacity, from which I learned many new things as I reaped many new skills and new inspiration on the topics I can take.  
To start with the work, I firstly think of recording the sound for a day in my every day life, which later I found it is not that innovative and decided to find another topic for my project. And by that time, I encountered the most important festival for Chinese which is the Spring Festival. Hence, I decided to change my project's topic to the day celebrating the Spring Festival. As my family is not in Pittsburgh, so this year's Spring Festival I celebrated along, with only phone calls and sending messages to connect with my family, which inspired me to take the sound of greeting my family through phone calls and the sound of the videos of fireworks as part of my project. I also includes some sound from the trip of that day such as taking bus and going back home as part of my project sound.  
Firstly and foremost, I gathered sound from the daily life as the trip of taking bus going back home and so on. And I picked those sound are most representative, connecting them together. During the New Year Eve, I recorded the phone call I took with my family. later I record the sound of firework that is taken in China. After that, I looked out some free sound to make those sounds to connected more natural and becoming more abundant.  
For the first draft of my work:  The work is a little rough, and there were no such much sounds in my draft, and the sound are not using any skills to make it more natural.

And at that time, I met a problem of how to show the fireworks sound is for I playing or say watch the firework videos missing my family, rather than I was setting a firework at some place. To reach that, I use the "reverb" skill on the firework sound, which is a new skill that I learned.  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3101795b-762e-47e2-9bb4-b1fdb61e7bb6)  
However, it still didn't make it to let the audience know it was playing out from my phone as in the peer review, my classmate didn't realized this point, so I added some message ring and button clicking which refers to that I receive messages from my family which indicate that the sound is coming out from my phone.   
And to make the firework sound more abundant, I make the sound to start from the left and pans to the right.  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029d1138-8fdf-4446-ac2c-23957d1b83fe)  
For the bus part and going back home part, I added some more free sound and use the fade-in, fade-out, noise reduction skills as well as space direction conversion. I also increased the amplitude of the broadcast sound on the bus to emphasize and highlight that this is on the bus , and also added a sound of bus  being stopped and opening door, also use the reduce noise in part of the bus sound part.

For the sound I going back home there are two direction's sound which can show that I was walking from a room (space) to another room (space).   
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72736e06-4b34-4c48-9719-185f83490bb3)  
To make those sounds connecting naturally, I used the fade-in and fade-out skills to connect them. For example, from the bus sound to the bus stop and opening the door, and to I opening my bag getting the keys to get in to my room and so on.  
**Classmate review**  
I appreciate for every suggestion I get from my classmates!

I took this advice on my firework sound to make it pans from left to the right.

For this, I have to say that I actually add the license of other sound , but for the format reason, it make looked confusing, and I have already adjust it and add the public domain lines to them.

Yes, for the previous version, it may sound a little abrupt. So I add more sound and use some skills such as fade-in and fade-out to make it better.

 I also worked a lot on this part, as previously this is a big problem that the sound didn't pass on what I want it to be. So I added some message rings some left right pans and so on to deal with it.  

**Baseline:**  
My sound is 3:34 which is in between the requirement of the time limit from 2 minutes to 4 minutes.
I have shift in locations for example form bus to path to home as well as from a space to another space.
I have at least sound recorded by me and at least one sound not by me with permission.
I list all my assets as well as credit file.
I have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file.
I meet deadlines and requirements from the assignment page.
I export a playable ("rendered") .mp3 file.
I use relative volume and other effects to signal distance(using fade-in fade-out for my sounds).
I use left/right pan and low/high pass filters to create a sense of (locations in) space (used for the part of the firework sound).
I have a clear organizational scheme that can articulate in your reflection, as I used the message ring and phone call ring to separate different evens, also the whole sound connection can show from one event to another in a well order.
I use background music to maintain continuity across time jumps / montage, for the phone call, I add firework background sound and the sound at restaurant sound to indicate continuity as actually those phone calls is cut into separate part from a total phone call and discard the part I don't need and connected back together.
I show evidence (e.g. from workshop feedback) that audience interpretation matches what you intended, as previously many people don't get the point that actually the sound for the first two firework is play out by phone, so I adjust my sound adding some message rings using reverb using sound pans and so on to indicate that.
I use Audacity effects or tools that are new to you, as this is the first time that I edit sound as well as using Audacity, everything to me is new.
I write clear commit messages that signal your process and progress.
I include a text transcript of your audio file for accessibility and improved search.
