This is the future site of So-and-So's audio narrative. 
The audio sound will be a record of going home from outside and looking at the previous record of firework from last year recalling the time celebrating for Chinese new year with my family before. And then I called my parents and having a phone call with them expressing greetings, care, and New Year's wishes.
Setting: outside of home, bus stop, home
